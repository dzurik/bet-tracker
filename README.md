Bet Tracker

This was my first javascript project alone and it was wrote only in vanilla javascript. In the future, this project is still in my plans to improve it to the next level. First of all, change the ugly, vanilla code ðŸ˜ƒ For choice the matches, use an API instead of write every single details manually. And a login, to handle more users.
